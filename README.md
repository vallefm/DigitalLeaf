# Digital Leaf

Capstone project by group: **Digital Leaf**
Members: Bishal Adhikari, Nathan Loomis, Freddy Valle, Sykong Yang

I was the team's tester.

For this capstone project, I was able to successfully build a professional-grade test automation solution from the ground up.
These tests are written in C# utiling the .NET and Selenium frameworks which were learned through my Software Engineering internship at Maverick Software.
