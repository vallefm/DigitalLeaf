Capstone project by group: **Digital Leaf**

I was the team's tester.

For this capstone project, I was able to successfully build a professional-grade test automation solution from the ground up.
These tests are written in C# utilizing the .NET and Selenium frameworks that I learned through my Software Engineering internship at Barbri Global.

You can find my testing solution in the "tests" folder.
